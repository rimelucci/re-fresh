# Re-fresh

**Project is now live at: http://104.236.207.202/**

Our project aims to reduce waste from places that have to sell their leftover food by the end of the day. 
  - Many stores and restaurants offer discounts at the end of the day on foods that would spoil or lose quality overnight.
  - With Re-Fresh, stores can post food that they need to sell by the end of the day and the discounted price they are selling for.


##With Re-Fresh, you save money, stores make more money, and less food goes to waste
###It's a win-win-win!
